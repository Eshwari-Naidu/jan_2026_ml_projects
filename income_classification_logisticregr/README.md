# Adult Income Prediction using Logistic Regression


This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether an individual's income exceeds **$50K/year** based on demographic and socioeconomic attributes from the UCI Adult Income dataset.


---


## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository (Adult Income Dataset)
- **Target Variable:** `income`
- `<=50K` → 0
- `>50K` → 1


---


## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Logistic Regression with **L1 regularization**
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Class imbalance inspection
- Feature correlation analysis
- Model evaluation metrics


---


## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn


---
## 🔍 Model Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Accuracy Score
- ROC Curve & AUC Score


---


## 📈 Key Insights
- L1 regularization helps identify the most influential features
- Education level, capital gain, and working hours show strong impact
- The ROC-AUC score indicates good class separation capability
