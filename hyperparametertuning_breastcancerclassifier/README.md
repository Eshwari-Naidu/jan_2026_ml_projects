# Breast Cancer Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


This project applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset available in `scikit-learn`.


---


## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`
- **Number of Features:** 30
- **Target Classes:**
- 0 → Malignant
- 1 → Benign


---


## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Instance-based learning (KNN)
- Train-validation split
- Hyperparameter tuning (value of k)
- Accuracy-based model comparison


---


## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib


---


## 📈 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy score for different values of **k (1–100)**
- Visualization of **k vs training accuracy**


---


## 🔍 Key Insights
- Smaller values of **k** tend to overfit the training data
- Accuracy stabilizes as k increases


---


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook
3. Run all cells to reproduce results
